          I wanted to analyze the most recent World Cup(2018) 
          with the 2022 World cup looming this winter, but I 
          wanted to compare the total # of goals scored in the 
          2018 World Cup to the total scored in 2014 to see the
          difference and what possibly could cause that difference. 
          Each path during a World Cup run is different and 
          I wanted to analyze the difference in 2014 and 2018!!
          In analyzing these two datasets, I looked through each dataset
          and looked at the variables named "Team, Goals For, and Goals Against.
          Using two data visualizations to compare the top total goals, which is
          goals for and goals against combined from the different years using two
          barplots.

      <h2> The Data </h2>

      I drew the data from Kaggle. You can look at it for yourself below:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2014.csv">2014 World Cup</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2018.csv">2018 World Cup</a></li>
      </ul>
      
    
      <h3> Importing Necessary Packages </h3>
      <pre><code>
      ## Need all of these imports not only for the visualization but to convert the csv to a dataframe to be able to use the
      ## data in code. 

import csv
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</pre></code>
