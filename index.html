        <p id="description"> 
          I wanted to analyze the two most recent 
          World Cup(2018 and 2014) with the 2022 World cup looming this winter, 
          but I wanted to compare the total # of goals scored in the 
          2018 World Cup to the total scored in 2014 to see the
          difference and what possibly could cause that difference. 
          Each path during a World Cup run is different and 
          I wanted to analyze the difference in 2014 and 2018!!
          In analyzing these two datasets, I looked through each dataset
          and looked at the variables named "Team, Goals For, and Goals Against.
          Using two data visualizations to compare the top total goals, which is
          goals for and goals against combined from the different years using two
          barplots.

      <h2> 1.The Data </h2>

      I drew the data from Kaggle. You can look at it for yourself below:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2014.csv">2014 World Cup</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2018.csv">2018 World Cup</a></li>
      </ul>
      
    
      <h3> Importing Necessary Packages </h3>
      <p> The code below was implented to use all the different packages to allow me to create visualization for my data
      and to be able to convert the .csv files.</p>

      <h2> 2.The Structure </h2>
      <p> The 2014 dataset was approximately 1.07 Kilobyte encoded as a .csv file. I read the file line by line and decided to iterate 
      through the csv_2014 file, and append the teams, goals for, goals against into list_2014 as a dictionary for speed optimization. 
      I would open the csv_2014 file and use the csv.reader as an object and place them into a list as a dictionary.
      The 2018 dataset was approximately 1.03 Kilobyte encoded as a .csv file. I read the file line by line and did the same iteration 
      for speed optimization and appending the variables that I am analyzing by putting them into list_2018 as a dictionary.</p>

      <h2> 3.Binary Search Tree Code! </h2>
	  
      <p> I wanted to do something that made this a little tougher. 
      The code demonstrated below is the creation of the BST to print out the top 5 teams with most total goals scored.
      (goals for and goals against combined)I used the binary search tree with the list_2014 and list_2018 code.
      I used a Binary Search Tree so that the elements also known as the variables in the parenthesis are sorted in order
      and can be looked through and replaced by a greater value if it is one.(The root is the highest valuable of the highest
      number of total goals scored.</p>

      <pre><code>Inorder code</code></pre>
      <img src="inorder1_code.png" alt="picture of inorder code" >
	  

      <h2> 4.The Analysis/Code </h2>
	  
      <pre><code> The code that is shown below is to print out the top 5 temas in order based off of the total goals scored(printing out the 
      numbers)in the two datasets that have been converted to lists. </code></pre>
      <img src="top5teams_code.png" alt="Top 5 Teams code" >

	  
     

      <pre><code> The Binary Search Tree printed these are the top 5 teams based off of total goals in both 2014 and 2018.</code></pre>
      <img src="top5teams_printed.png" alt="Top 5 Teams printed" >
	  
      
      <h2> 5.Visualization </h2>
	  
	  	 
	  <div id="inline">
		 <img src="2014_top5.png" alt="Top 5 Teams 2014" width="375" height="375">

		 <img src="2018_top5.png" alt="Top 5 Teams 2018" width="375" height="375">
	  </div>

      <p> After finishing the code and having the top 5 teams printed in both years I wanted to visualize both of the results with two 
      seaborn barplots to compare and showthe difference in total number of goals and to make some inferences and ask some follow up questions.
