        <p id="description"> 
          I wanted to analyze the two most recent 
          World Cup(2018 and 2014) with the 2022 World cup looming this winter, 
          but I wanted to compare the total # of goals scored in the 
          2018 World Cup to the total scored in 2014 to see the
          difference and what possibly could cause that difference. 
          Each path during a World Cup run is different and 
          I wanted to analyze the difference in 2014 and 2018!!
          In analyzing these two datasets, I looked through each dataset
          and looked at the variables named "Team, Goals For, and Goals Against.
          Using two data visualizations to compare the top total goals, which is
          goals for and goals against combined from the different years using two
          barplots.

      <h2> The Data </h2>

      I drew the data from Kaggle. You can look at it for yourself below:

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2014.csv">2014 World Cup</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset?select=FIFA+-+2018.csv">2018 World Cup</a></li>
      </ul>
      
    
      <h3> Importing Necessary Packages </h3>
      <p> The code below was implented to use all the different packages to allow me to create visualization for my data
      and to be able to convert the .csv files.</p>

      <h4> The Structure </h4>
      <p> The 2014 dataset was approximately 1.07 Kilobyte encoded as a .csv file. I read the file line by line and decided to iterate 
      through the csv_2014 file, and append the teams, goals for, goals against into list_2014 as a dictionary for speed optimization. 
      I would open the csv_2014 file and use the csv.reader as an object and place them into a list as a dictionary.
      The 2018 dataset was approximately 1.03 Kilobyte encoded as a .csv file. I read the file line by line and did the same iteration 
      for speed optimization and appending the variables that I am analyzing by putting them into list_2018 as a dictionary.</p>

      <pre><code>2018</code></pre>
      <img src="2018_iteration.png" alt="picture of code 2018" >

      <p> The code below was implented to ensure that all the code below it can be ran since it is imported.</p>

      <h5> Binary Search Tree Code! </h5>
	  
      <p> I wanted to do something that made this a little tougher. 
      The code demonstrated below is the creation of the BST to print out the top 5 teams with most total goals scored.
      (goals for and goals against combined)I used the binary search tree with the list_2014 and list_2018 code.
      I used a Binary Search Tree so that the elements also known as the variables in the parenthesis are sorted in order
      and can be looked through and replaced by a greater value if it is one.(The root is the highest valuable of the highest
      number of total goals scored.</p>
	  
      <pre><code>BST class code</code></pre>
      <img src="BST_code.png" alt="picture of class code" >
	  
      <p> The code below was implented to ensure that all the new values for the total goals scored variable are sorted in order.</p>
