  <p> I wanted to analyze the most recent World Cup(2018) with the 2022 World cup looming this winter, but I wanted to compare the total # of goals scored in the 2018 World Cup to the total scored in 2014 to see the difference and what possibly could cause that difference. Each path during a World Cup run is different and I wanted to analyze the difference in 2014 and 2018 </p>
