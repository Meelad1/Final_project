          I wanted to analyze the most recent World Cup(2018) 
          with the 2022 World cup looming this winter, but I 
          wanted to compare the total # of goals scored in the 
          2018 World Cup to the total scored in 2014 to see the
          difference and what possibly could cause that difference. 
          Each path during a World Cup run is different and 
          I wanted to analyze the difference in 2014 and 2018!!
          In analyzing these two datasets, I looked through each dataset
          and looked at the variables named "Team, Goals For, and Goals Against.
          Using one data visualization/graph to compare these two datasets 
          instead of putting them up side by side.

      <h2> The Data </h2>

      I drew from Kaggle. You can look at the data for yourself:
